# manhwa-translator
An automatic translator for manga/manhwa/manhua.

Incomplete.

So far it can:  
	- detect text in an image.  
	- remove said text and (somewhat) fill in the missing background.  
	- add new text to the same location as old text (somewhat).  

Missing:  
	- actual manhwa-style translation.
	

NOTE: Needs pipenv to work (in requirements.txt) and then install everything in requirements-env.txt.  
Also note: I don't know if you need requirements-env.txt but it's there if you need it.  
Last Note: If you're used to using pipenv then carry on, otherwise you may need to allow PowerShell to execute scripts without signing in Search > Developer Settings (Windows 10)
